# javaExamples

In my study I often need to breakdown a problem to its core or a functionality that I don't want to implement in a bigger project at first, just trial and error on a "initial system". So I came up with the idea to make small example projects. So far so good but over time I lost many of them, therefore I decided to create a repository where all the example staff stays until  I need them. 

May it helps you the same as me (sometimes ;) )
